    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The bright citrus and tangy-sweet tomatoes are full of flavor, especially
      when backed by the creamy richness of the avocado. Roast tomatoes until
      they're caramelized and bursting, then add them to a bed of arugula topped
      with a sliced avocado. Dress everything with a sweet and tangy combination
      of citrus juice and pomegranate molasses. Top with basil for freshness and
      pumpkin seeds for crunch.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup sungold cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>tablespoon grapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon pomegranate molasses, divided</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 handful arugula</li>
      <li>1 to 2 pink variegated lemons</li>
      <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 large avocado</li>
      <li>1 small handful roasted and salted pepitas</li>
      <li>2 to 3 fresh basil leaves, chiffonaded</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oven to 400Â° F.</li>
      <li>
        Place a piece of parchment on a baking sheet (line the pan with foil if
        you're concerned about protecting it) and arrange the tomatoes in the
        center. Pour the grapeseed oil and 1 tablespoon of the pomegranate
        molasses over the tomatoes and rub them until they're well-coated.
        Sprinkle with kosher salt. The molasses will pool on the baking sheet,
        so be sure all of the tomatoes are swimming in that pool. Bake for 25 to
        30 minutes, until tomatoes are beginning to burst and look a bit
        caramel-y.
      </li>
      <li>Lay out a bed of arugula on your serving dish.</li>
      <li>
        Combine the juice of the pink variegated lemons with the lime juice and
        the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of pomegranate molasses in a small bowl. Set
        aside for a moment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the avocado into large sections (I sliced mine lengthwise, because
        that seemed sexier to me) and arrange them over the arugula. Sprinkle
        slices with kosher salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the citrus mixture over the avocado and arugula. Add tomatoes
        straight from the oven so that they're still warm when you serve it. Top
        with pepitas and chiffonaded basil.
      </li>
      <li>Take off your pants and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
