    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This ragu will abso-toot-ly knock your socks off. It depends on cooking
      the meat first, low and slow, with the same aromatic vegetables that will
      go into the base. The meat is then shredded, folded in, and cooked just
      long enough to amalgamate.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 to 4 pounds oxtail, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup, plus 3 tablespoons, extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 small onions, divided</li>
      <li>6 carrots, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Italian double concentrate tomato paste, divided</li>
      <li>head garlic, sliced in half horizontally</li>
      <li>1 bottle red wine</li>
      <li>35-ounce can San Marzano tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 sprigs thyme, rosemary, or savory</li>
      <li>1/2 bunch parsley</li>
      <li>bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      Heat the oven to 250° F. Get out a heavy enameled cast-iron pan and warm
      it over high heat. Pat the oxtail dry and season liberally with salt and
      pepper.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add the olive oil to the pan and add the oxtail one at a time in a single
      layer, working in batches if necessary. Brown each oxtail on either side,
      about 6 to 8 minutes a side. When all the oxtail is browned, drain the fat
      from the pan and set the meat aside.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add 1 chopped onion, 4 chopped carrots, and 4 chopped stalks of celery to
      the pan and lower the heat to medium. Let them brown and wilt for a few
      minutes in the oil, then add one tablespoon of tomato paste and let cook 5
      to 6 more minutes.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add the oxtail, garlic halves, and the red wine and bring to a boil. If
      the wine doesn't cover the meat, add water until the meat is covered. When
      the wine is boiling, scrape the browned bits up off the bottom of the pan.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Reduce heat and braise in the 250° F oven for 3 to 4 hours, until falling
      apart tender.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Meanwhile, take the remaining carrots (2), celery (2), and onion (1), and
      the herbs and parsley and chop finely in a food processor.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-low heat in a
      large Dutch oven-type pan. Sauté the chopped vegetables and herbs in the
      oil. After 7 to 8 minutes, when the onions start to get translucent, add
      3/4 cup of water to the pan and dissolve the remaining tablespoon of
      tomato paste in it. Let cook until all the liquid is reduced and the
      vegetables are practically dissolved.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Add the can of San Marzano tomatoes and break up with a fork, wooden
      spoon, or potato masher. Let this simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then
      reserve for the oxtail.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      When the oxtail is done, filter off all the cooking liquid and let it
      separate. Then remove the fat that rises to the top layer as completely as
      you can. Add the filtered liquid to the cooking vegetables and tomatoes
      and bring to a simmer. When the oxtail is cool enough to handle, pick the
      meat off and add it to the pot of vegetables, tomatoes, and cooking
      liquid.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Simmer everything together until all the elements are amalgamated and the
      juices have reduced to a slightly syrupy consistency just rich enough to
      coat a pasta noodle, 20 to 35 minutes. At this point, the ragu can be
      eaten immediately or refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for 3 to 4
      months.
