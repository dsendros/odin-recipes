    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Some people don't like the raw texture of kale salads, but if some hot
      ingredients are added to the raw kale, it wilts just enough to tone down
      the grassy chewiness. Lemon and anchovy bring out the umami in the
      dressing. Roasted onions with fresh thyme and rosemary add a lot of
      flavor. Despite a few steps (making croutons and roasting onions), this
      dish comes together fairly quickly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Salad dressing
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
          <li>1/2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
          <li>
            12 capers, roughly chopped (if salt-packed, rinse before chopping)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 to 2 large anchovies, roughly chopped (if salt-packed, remove
            tail, fins, and bones before chopping)
          </li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
          <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The rest of the salad
        <ul>
          <li>2 sweet onions, preferably Vidalia or Walla-Walla</li>
          <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
          <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, about 1 inch long</li>
          <li>3 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
          <li>
            2 to 3 slices day-old, best-quality bread (I like ciabatta or
            sourdough boule)
          </li>
          <li>1 small bunch Lacinato kale</li>
          <li>2 slices thick cut bacon</li>
          <li>
            1/2 cup grated ricotta salata cheese (or you can substitute feta)
          </li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        MAKE SALAD DRESSING: Add lemon juice, rice wine vinegar, capers,
        anchovy, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce to bowl of blender and whir
        until thoroughly mixed and smooth. (If you’d rather not deal with the
        hassle getting your blender out, you can make this dressing with a hand
        blender.) With motor of blender or hand blender running, add olive oil
        in a thin stream until thoroughly emulsified. Taste -- the dressing
        should taste vibrant and lemony. Add a pinch or two of salt, a grind of
        pepper, and more lemon if needed. Put dressing aside until needed.
        (Note: Dressing can be made a few days ahead. Keep in a glass jar in the
        refrigerator and let sit out for about 15 minutes before dressing the
        salad.)
      </li>
      <li>
        ROAST ONIONS: Heat oven to 350° F. Cut onions in half, then slice in
        half moons about 1/4-inch thick. Place onions, thyme, and rosemary on
        rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and mix with
        your hands until herbs and onion slices are coated. Add 1/4 teaspoon
        salt and a grind or two of black pepper. Mix with your hands again.
        Place pan in oven and roast for about 40 to 50 minutes or until onion
        slices have turned golden and soft and are caramelized. Start checking
        after about 30 minutes and remove onions before they begin to char.
        Burnt onions are not delicious!
      </li>
      <li>
        MAKE CROUTONS: Cut bread into large bite-sized cubes. Keep crusts on for
        more rustic croutons. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in large heavy
        pan. (I use a cast iron pan.) Add bread cubes and cook over low heat,
        turning occasionally, until all surfaces of bread cubes are toasted and
        golden. Remove and set on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with salt
        while still warm and set aside. (Croutons can be made a few days ahead.
        Store in airtight container at room temperature.)
      </li>
      <li>
        PREPARE KALE: Wash kale in cold water. Several rinses may be needed to
        remove dirt and grit. Dry kale with a few layers of kitchen towels.
        Working carefully, remove thick stems from kale and roll kale leaves
        into long cigarette-style rolls. Cut kale into very thin strips. Add
        kale to salad bowl or serving plate. Pour 3/4 of the salad dressing over
        kale and toss with tongs or your hands until all leaves are coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        COOK BACON: When onions are just starting to turn golden at the tips,
        slice bacon lengthwise and then cut into 1-inch pieces. Sauté bacon in
        small skillet over medium low heat until cooked and crunchy. Pour bacon
        onto kale. If there is any rendered bacon fat in the skillet, add a
        spoonful of this to the kale, if you like. Remove onions from the oven
        and add half of them and any juices to kale. (Save rest of onions for
        another use -- as a salad ingredient, sandwich topping, or to fill
        omelets or burritos.) Mix thoroughly with your hands or tongs -- the hot
        onions and bacon will slightly wilt the kale.
      </li>
      <li>
        FINISHING THE SALAD: Add croutons and ricotta salata to salad. Pour in
        reserved salad dressing if salad looks a little dry. Toss again. Taste
        and adjust seasonings if needed, adding a pinch or two of salt, a grind
        of pepper, or additional lemon. We enjoy this salad for dinner with a
        hearty vegetarian soup or fresh fish, simply prepared. Enjoy!
