This is the Recipes project for The Odin Project. 

I created a basic homepage with links to three recipe pages. In doing so, I demonstrated ability to use html features like links, ordered and unordered lists, and images. I also demonstrated my ability to use git and GitHub by using features like commit messages and issues.
